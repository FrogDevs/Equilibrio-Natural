## Tech Stack

**Server:** Node and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

## Li√ß√µes aprendidas

**What challenges were faced and how were they overcome?**

Integrate the Firestore Database API into the project. The way we found to include real-time data from the database was to install the Firebase/Firestore SDK and use the ``onSnapshot()`` method.

## Optimizations

**What optimizations have been made to the code?**

The **Pnpm** package manager was chosen for the project because it offers *cold and hot caching*. Pnpm is 3x faster and more efficient than Npm and faster than Yarn. Dealing with numerous libraries and modules was an easier and safer task with this tool.

**Vite** is a tool with the utility to take care of the application bundle. It provides better optimization techniques, resulting in higher application performance both in development and production form for the end user.

When building applications with a bundler, the JavaScript package can become quite large, and thus affect page load time. It is more efficient to split the components of each route into separate chunks and only load them when the route is visited. With this in mind, a technique known as *Lazy Load Routes* was used. **Vue Router** offers native support for the technique. [Read more.](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/lazy-loading.html)

The site was built using the *Mobile First* concept. This concept refers to creating any design that prioritizes the experience on mobile devices, while making adaptations for higher resolutions. This allows the site to be completely responsive and adaptable to other screen resolutions, allowing for greater customer inclusion.

## Demo

We use Netlify for the online implementation of the site
